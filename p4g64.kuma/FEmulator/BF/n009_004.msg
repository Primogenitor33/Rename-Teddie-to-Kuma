[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 4 6 7 1 4 1]...Is there something you need?[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]Many people from the town come and[n]meet here. It's a very convenient[n]location, isn't it...?[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 4 7 0 0 0]> Wasn't this the boy who met with Kanji[n]some time ago...?[n][f 1 4][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]> He may know something about Kanji...[n][f 1 4][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 4 6 7 1 4 1]......?[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]You're asking if anything seemed strange[n]when I spoke to Kanji-kun, yes...?[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]Hmm. Very well.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]It seems to be an urgent matter,[n]so I'll simply tell you.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]If you're asking about recent events,[n]then yes, there was something out of[n]the ordinary.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]It was something I felt when I was[n]with him... So I told him outright that[n]he seemed to be an [f 0 1 2]odd person[f 0 1 0].[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]After I said that, his expression changed[n]all of a sudden... I was quite surprised.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]On that basis, I believe his actions were[n]somewhat forced and unnatural throughout[n]the time I was with him.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]He may have some sort of [f 0 1 2]complex[f 0 1 0]...[n]Though I have no proof of this.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 4 7 0 0 0]> It seems Kanji has a [f 0 1 2]complex[f 0 1 0] or[n]something of that nature...[n][f 1 4][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]> Kanji's purported reaction to the[n]phrase "odd person"...[n][f 1 4][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]> Maybe this is enough of a clue for[n]Kuma to go on...[n][f 1 4][e]

[msg MSG_NPC_04_01_1]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]> You've gathered enough information.[n]You should report to Kuma tomorrow.[n][f 1 1][e]

[msg MSG_NPC_04_01_2]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]> You should report to Kuma as soon[n]as possible.[n][f 1 1][e]

[msg MSG_NPC_04_02 [Slender young man]]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 4 6 7 4 4 1]I simply had the feeling that he harbors[n]some sort of [f 0 1 2]complex[f 0 1 0], that's all.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 4 7 0 0 0]> This may be a hint to finding Kanji...[n]It would be best to report to Kuma.[n][f 1 4][e]

[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]Kuma-chan is such a good salesman that I[n]almost bought my vegetables here.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]But they're too expensive at Junes...[n]and besides, my grandfather is very[n]picky about his produce.[n][f 1 1][e]
