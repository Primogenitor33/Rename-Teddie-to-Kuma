[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 4 6 3 7 65535 1]A swimsuit competition? Really!? Sheesh,[n]that Kuma...[n][f 1 1][e]

[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]I went to Junes the other day and Yosuke[n]was working like a madman to sell cakes.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 4 8 3 15]He was yelling at Kuma for eating all the[n]chicken off the tasting table...[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]You got any plans for Christmas this year,[n][f 4 2]-kun?[n][f 1 1][e]

[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 4 6 3 2 65535 1][f 4 8 3 10]Haha, well, it's true it gets lonely fast,[n]being home alone.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]Isn't it hard with just two guys in the[n]house? I could come over and cook...[n][f 1 1][e]

[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 4 9 3 3 5 0 5][f 4 6 3 2 65535 1]Kuma's always eating snacks, right? I bet[n]his diet is anything but balanced.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 4 6 3 1 65535 1][f 4 8 3 2]Huh... does Kuma even need nutrition...?[n][f 1 1][e]

[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 4 6 3 2 65535 1]Youske's been complaining about what a hassle[n]he is, but I bet he's glad inside to have[n]Kuma back.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 4 9 3 3 5 0 5][f 4 8 3 10]Whatever those two might say, they make a[n]pretty good pair.[n][f 1 1][e]
