[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]The Culture Festival sure had a lot of[n]stuff to see this year. Even my mother[n]decided to come.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]She's been a huge fan of Kuma ever[n]since. If she catches him at Junes,[n]she's happy for the rest of the day.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]...I can see where she's coming from,[n]though. Kuma is pretty awesome.[n][f 1 1][e]

[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]Valentine's Day, huh. *sigh*[n]I don't think I'll have any luck [n]his year.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]Mom seems kind of pumped up about it,[n]though. She says she's going to give[n]something to Kuma-san.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]I hear she has tons of rivals among the[n]housewives. This Kuma-san must be[n]pretty impressive.[n][f 1 1][e]

[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 4 9 8 3 10 0 10][f 4 6 47 1 0 1]...You're outta here, huh? I heard about[n]it from Kuma.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]...He's really fond of you, [f 4 2]. [n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 4 6 47 2 0 1]Makes me jealous just to say it, but,[n]can you try to cheer him up?[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]He's pretty down right now, but I think[n]he's accepted that you're leaving. I'll[n]take good care of him for you.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]> She seems enthusiastic about looking[n]after Kuma...[n][f 1 4][e]
